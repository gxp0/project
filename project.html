    <p>The iPhone (colloquially known, retronymically, as the iPhone 2G, the first iPhone, and iPhone 1 after 2008 to differentiate it from later models) is the first smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007,[9] and was later released in the United States on June 29, 2007. It featured quad-band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer.

Development of the iPhone dated back to 2005, when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs conceived the idea. The design was expanded upon over the next 2 years in complete secrecy, before being announced in Q1 of 2007.
   </p>
   <p>The iPhone was released in the United States on June 29, 2007 at the price of $499 for the 4 GB model and $599 for the 8 GB model, both requiring a 2-year contract.[20] Thousands of people were reported to have waited outside Apple and AT&T retail stores days before the device's launch;[21] many stores reported stock shortages within an hour of availability</p>
   <p>At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop class applications",[33][34] but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed "iPhone OS".[35]

The original iPhone supported three major versions of the operating system before it was discontinued: iPhone OS 1, 2, and 3. The last update the original iPhone received was iPhone OS 3.1.3. It never got the full iPhone OS 3 feature set because iPhone OS 3.2 was intended for the iPad.</p>

   <h4 class="phone">iphone 3g</h4>
   <div class="para">
      <p>  The iPhone 3G is a smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc.; it is the second generation of iPhone, successor to the original iPhone, and was introduced on June 9, 2008, at the WWDC 2008 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, United States.

The iPhone 3G is internally similar to its predecessor, but included several new hardware features, such as GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. The device was originally loaded with the concurrently launched iPhone OS 2.0. In addition to other features (including push email and turn-by-turn navigation), this new operating system introduced the App Store—Apple's new distribution platform for third-party applications.[10]
</p>
<p>The iPhone 3G came preloaded with the latest version of iOS and continued to receive updates to its software for over two years, with major iterations released on an annual basis. However, the phone had access to a decreasing proportion of new features with each update as its hardware became superseded by later models.

When it was launched, the iPhone 3G came preloaded with iPhone OS 2.0. This introduced the App Store, Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync support, Apple's MobileMe service, and push email support, along with other new features and bug fixes.

In June 2009, iPhone 3G users received the iPhone OS 3.0 software update, which introduced the long-awaited MMS feature, copy and paste, landscape support for more applications, Bluetooth stereo support, and other improvements.
</p>
<p>On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G across twenty-two countries in two storage options, 8GB and 16GB. The 16GB model was produced in either black or white.[11][12]

Following the release of the successor iPhone 3GS model one year later, the iPhone 3G remained on sale but became Apple's budget phone offer, with its price cut in half. This $99 iPhone 3G required a two-year contract and was available only in black and with 8 GB of storage, but came bundled with the then-new iPhone OS 3.0 firmware.[13] On June 7, 2010, the iPhone 3G was finally discontinued, and replaced as Apple's budget phone by an 8GB iPhone 3GS selling for the same price of $99 with a 2-year contract.

<h4 class="phone">iphone 4</h4>
<div class="para">
  <p>
  The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation iPhone, succeeding the 3GS and preceding the 4S. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[8] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna, with internal components situated between aluminosilicate glass.[9] The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's new high-resolution "Retina Display" with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors. The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple's new FaceTime video chat service. The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a front-facing camera, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.
  <p>
  <p>The display of the iPhone 4 is manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen is marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 305 millimetres (12 in) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel[49] is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.[50] With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12 inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.
  </p>
  <p>The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by Jony Ive, a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and first-generation iPhone SE. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from its predecessor.[65]

It is 115 millimetres (4.5 in) high, 58.6 millimetres (2.31 in) wide, and 9.4 millimetres (0.37 in) deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is 116 millimetres (4.6 in) high, 62 millimetres (2.4 in) wide, and 12 millimetres (0.47 in) deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS. Steve Jobs claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."[65] The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.
</p>
<p>The iPhone 4 shipped with iOS 4, which was the newest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.[67] It also introduced FaceTime, which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and OS X users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to iOS 7, released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, certain features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include Siri, 3D maps and turn-by-turn navigation, AirDrop, AirPlay mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the parallax effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.[68] While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.[69][70]

<h4 class="phone">iphone 5</h4>
<div class="para">
  <p>The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the sixth generation of the iPhone succeeding the iPhone 4S and preceding the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. Formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, it was released on September 21, 2012.[12] The iPhone 5 is the first iPhone to be announced in September and, setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs.

The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second Apple phone to include its new Sony-made 8 MP camera, which was first introduced on the iPhone 4S.
</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[34] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[35] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[35]

The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.[34] Many of the iPhone 5's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.[36] Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.[37]
</p>
<p>Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.[17] The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.[46] The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, "looks beautiful when it wears".[47]

The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s.[48] The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick. At the September 2012 conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measured 6.65 mm (0.262 in) at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm (0.28 in) at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.
</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.[12][53][54] The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.[55][56] The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported.[57] The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had.[58] The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture[59] than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.[60] The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh[8] is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.[61][62] This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.

<h4 class="phone">iphone 6</h4>
 <div class="para">
    <p>The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5S, and was announced on September 9, 2014 and released on September 19, 2014.[18] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7 and 5.5 inches (120 and 140 mm) displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near field communications-based mobile payments offering
    </p>
    <p>The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.[40] The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.[41] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date. The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as "Retina HD Display" and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern, so that every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display
    </p>
    <p>Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s
    </p>
    <p>When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8, while the iPhone 5S was supplied pre-loaded with iOS 7. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and 5S can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner.[19][20] In June 2019, Apple announced that it will drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.

  <h4 class="phone">iphone 7</h4>
  <div class="para">
    <p>The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the tenth generation of iPhone. They were announced on September 16, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 21, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September 16, 2016.
    </p>
    <p>iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant,[42] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[43] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[44]

iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[45][46] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[47] iPhone 7 retains the 3D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.
</p>
<p>
  iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[51]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming".[52] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7 in (120 mm) screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5 in (140 mm) screen.[53] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[24] and increased brightness.[54] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[55][56]

Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[57] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB, and max out at 256 GB.[58] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3 GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[51] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2 GB.[59]
</p>
<p>
  The iPhone 7 originally shipped with iOS 10 pre-installed.[62] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[63] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus.[64][65]

<h4 class="phone">iphone 8</h4>
<div class="para">
  <p>The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the eleventh generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 12, 2017, alongside the higher-end iPhone X, at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus, and were released on September 22, 2017, succeeding iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were discontinued by Apple on April 15, 2020 with the release of the second-generation iPhone SE.

Besides the addition of a glass back, the designs of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors. Notable changes include the addition of inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.
</p>
<p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in the iPhone 7,[12] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[9] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.
  The iPhone 8 features a 12 MP camera with autofocus, f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second.[14] The iPhone 8 Plus upgrades the main camera for a wide-angle lens with up to 10× digital zoom or 2× optical zoom,[15] and retains a second, telephoto lens similar to the one found on the iPhone 7 Plus, but with improved depth-of-field and lighting effects in Portrait mode.[16] Both models have a 7 MP front camera with an f/2.2 aperture capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 frames per second and 720p video at 240 frames per second, along with face detection and high-dynamic range.
</p>
<p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus contain the Apple A11 Bionic system-on-chip, a hexa-core processor that the company says features two cores that are 25% faster than the iPhone 7's A10 processor and four cores that are 70% faster than the prior model. The phones also feature an Apple-designed graphics processing unit 30% faster than prior units, with the same level of performance as the A10 at half the power.

<h4 class="phone">iphone X</h4>
<div class="para">
   <p>The iPhone X (Roman numeral "X" pronounced "ten")[9][10] is a smartphone designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the eleventh generation of the iPhone and was announced on September 12, 2017, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus. It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017.

The iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and "bezel-less" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a "chin", unlike many Android phones. It was the first iPhone to use an OLED screen. The home button was replaced with a new type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan the user's face to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.
</p>
<p>
  The iPhone X has a 5.85 inch (marketed as 5.8 inch) OLED color-accurate screen that supports DCI-P3 wide color gamut, sRGB, and high dynamic range,[30][31] and has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1.[32] The Super Retina display has the True Tone technology found on the iPad Pro, which uses ambient light sensors to adapt the display's white balance to the surrounding ambient light.[33][34] Although the iPhone X does not feature the same "ProMotion" technology used in the displays of the second-generation iPad Pro, where the display delivers a refresh rate of 120 Hz, it does sample touch input at 120 Hz.
  The iPhone X has two color options; silver and space gray.[33] The sides of the phone are composed of surgical-grade stainless steel to improve durability, and the front and back are made of glass. The design is intended to be IP67 water and dust resistant.[33][42]

The iPhone X contains Apple's A11 Bionic system-on-chip, also used in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which is a six-core processor with two cores optimized for performance (25% faster than the A10 Fusion processor), along with four cores optimized for efficiency (70% faster than the previous generation).[43] It also features the first Apple-designed graphics processing unit[44][45] and a Neural Engine, which powers an artificial intelligence accelerator.
</p>
<p>The iPhone X has two cameras on the rear. One is a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/1.8 aperture, with support for face detection, high dynamic range and optical image stabilization. It is capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30 or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second.[51] A secondary, telephoto lens features 2× optical zoom and 10× digital zoom with an aperture of f/2.4 and optical image stabilization.[52] A Portrait Mode is capable of producing photos with specific depth-of-field and lighting effects.[53] It also has a quad-LED True Tone flash with 2× better light uniformity

<h4 class="phone">iphone 11</h4>
  <div class="para">
    <p>The iPhone 11 is a smartphone designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation lower-priced iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR. It was unveiled on September 10, 2019, alongside the higher-end iPhone 11 Pro flagship at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2019, and was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.

The prominent changes compared with the iPhone XR are the Apple A13 Bionic chip, and an ultra wide dual camera system.[5] While the iPhone 11 Pro comes with an 18 W Lightning to USB-C fast charger, the iPhone 11 comes with the same 5 W charger found on previous iPhones, even though this faster charger is compatible with both models.[6][7]
</p>
<p>The iPhone 11 is available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White, and Product Red. There is a notch at the front for the TrueDepth camera system and speaker, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. There is a bump in the back for the cameras and the flash that is the same size as the iPhone 11 Pro, although the iPhone 11 only has two cameras compared to the Pro's three cameras.[7][4] Also, the iPhone 11 has a matte glass rear camera housing and glossy glass back, while the iPhone 11 Pro has a glossy glass rear camera housing and matte glass back. The Apple logo is now centered on the back of the device with no text, a change from previous models.
</p>
The iPhone 11, along with the iPhone 11 Pro, uses Apple's A13 Bionic processor, which contains a third-generation neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256GB. It also has 4 GB of RAM.[13] The iPhone 11 has an IP68 water and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to two meters for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and come with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector.[7][13] The iPhone 11 is the first smartphone with built-in ultra-wideband hardware, via its Apple U1 chip.[14][15][16]
The iPhone 11 has a 6.1 in (15.5 cm) IPS LCD, unlike the Pro models which have OLED displays.

The resolution is 1792 × 828 pixels (1.5 megapixels at 326 ppi) with a maximum brightness of 625 nits and a 1400:1 contrast ratio. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, True-Tone, and wide color gamut. As with the iPhone 11 Pro, XR, XS, and X, the display has a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and the speaker. The display has an oleophobic coating that is fingerprint-resistant.[7][13] Apple announced in September 2019 that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro would show a warning notification if a display was replaced with an unauthorized part. Apple stated that problems with the phone could arise if the wrong parts or procedures were used during the repair process.[17]
The iPhone 11 includes a dual-lens 12 MP rear camera array. There is one ƒ/2.4 ultra wide angle lens with a 120 degree field of view and 2x optical zoom out and one ƒ/1.8 wide angle lens. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video at up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.[7] The phone also features an audio zoom feature which focuses audio on the area that is being zoomed in on, similar to the Pro model.[13] Both of the cameras support video although only the primary lens has OIS. It supports a Portrait Mode with depth control and an advanced Bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic Night Mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low light environments. There is also a redesigned camera app that adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and a feature called “QuickTake,” which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature which takes advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing and was released via iOS 13.2 software update on October 29.[7][13][18]
